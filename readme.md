## 📌 Overview  
This repository was created as part of my journey to learn backend development with the MERN stack.  
It demonstrates how to build and structure backend applications using models, controllers, and routers while applying real-world best practices.

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- Node.js – JavaScript runtime environment  
- Express.js – Web framework for handling APIs  
- MongoDB + Mongoose – Database and Object Data Modeling (ODM)  
- REST APIs – For communication between client and server  

## ✨ Features  
- CRUD operations with MongoDB & Mongoose  
- Organized structure using MVC architecture  
- Clean and modular code for better scalability  
- Error handling and debugging practices  
- Exposure to real-world backend development challenges  

## 📖 Learning Outcomes  
Working on this project provided me with hands-on experience in:  
- Designing and structuring backend applications  
- Implementing controllers, routers, and models  
- Handling debugging sessions and improving patience during problem-solving  
- Strengthening logic building and critical thinking skills  
- Gaining confidence in backend development  

## 🏆 Conclusion  
This project is more than just code—it represents my persistence in learning backend development.  
From sleepless nights of debugging to finally building functional APIs, I discovered the importance of patience, calmness, and structured thinking.
